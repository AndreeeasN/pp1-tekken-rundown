# The Unofficial TEKKEN Rundown

[The Unofficial TEKKEN Rundown website](https://andreeeasn.github.io/pp1-tekken-rundown/) was developed both to shed some light on the long-lasting history of the TEKKEN franchise and potentially attract some new players to the scene.
The user can scroll through a gallery of mainline TEKKEN games released over the years as well as some interesting spin-off titles featuring TEKKEN characters. 
The user may also read through the Beginner's Guide for a push in the right direction should they be willing to learn more about playing the game, as well as sign up for a newsletter regarding new TEKKEN releases, large tournament events and developer commentary.
