                        TEKKEN Tag Tournament features over 35 characters from the first three TEKKEN games, and allows players to select two characters to form a team. 
                        Players can swap between the two characters at any time during the match, allowing out-of-battle characters a moment to regain some health. 
                        The game featured a different storyline from the main TEKKEN series, as it was set in a non-canon tournament where fighters would pair up and compete in teams
                        <br>
                        Tekken Tag Tournament was well-received for its unique tag-team gameplay and was praised for both graphics and soundtrack.

                        Featuring similar mechanics as its predecessor, Tekken Tag Tournament 2 expanded upon the tag-based gameplay with an even larger roster that included every character from previous Tekken games.
                        The game introduced new gameplay features such as Tag Assault, where both characters could perform a combo together, and the ability to tag in mid-air.
                        Additionally, the game featured a revamped online mode with improved matchmaking and netcode, as well as the ability to watch and save replays of matches.

                        With its large roster, refined gameplay, and extensive customization options, Tekken Tag Tournament 2 was a fan-favorite installment in the Tekken series.

                        Street Fighter X Tekken is a crossover fighting game that features characters from both the Street Fighter and Tekken franchises. 
                        The game retains the 2D gameplay of Street Fighter while incorporating Tekken-style special moves and juggles. 
                        It introduces the Gem System, which allows players to customize their characters with various power-ups and abilities.
                        <br>
                        The game was generally well-received for its polished gameplay and extensive roster of characters. 
                        However, it also faced criticism for its on-disc DLC controversy, where additional characters and costumes were found on the game disc but required players to pay extra to unlock them.

                        Tekken Revolution was a free-to-play fighting game released exclusively for the PlayStation 3 in 2013. 
                        It featured an extensive roster of Tekken characters and introduced a new mechanic called "Special Arts," which allowed players to perform powerful moves with a unique visual flair.
                        The game also introduced a character leveling system where players could level up their favorite characters by gaining experience points through battles. 
                        <br>
                        Tekken Revolution received mixed reviews from fans due to its limited content and heavy emphasis on microtransactions. 
                        The game was ultimately shut down in 2017 due to declining player numbers.
